# CONTRIBUTING

## Thanks you in advance for contributing!

To add new content:

* Make sure it doesn't already exist.
* Most of the consensus are created and developed by projects themselves, and require to copy or explain some part of their White-paper. But there is no copyright infringement intended from my side. Just a try to list all consensus algorithms.
* Link to PDF is required. Open knowledge is mandatory. Papers where the PDF is not publicly and openly available for free will not be accepted.
* Don't add deck of slides, or document lacking an abstract, not a blog post, not a bitcoin forum post.
* Conference or journal and year must be stated if available.

Please stay on topic!
