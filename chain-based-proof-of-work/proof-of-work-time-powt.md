# Proof-of-work time \(PoWT\)

Proof-of-Work-Time \(PoWT\) is a novel approach to forming a consensus by introducing a variable blocktime that scales with mining power, where the blockchain speeds up with power increases. This better scales the blockchain, increases transaction speed with power and allows for auto-adjusting more profitable mining. Difficulty dependent blocktime \(Max ~6.2 minutes, minimum 15 seconds\).

Blocktime dependent rewards \(~Reward halving every minute decrease in blocktime till 10x VRC supply parity, then variable ~3% disinflation\). Algo: scrypt² \(N of 1024² or 128MB per thread\) Block 1: 564,705 VRM minted for ICO participants who purchased VRM using VRC. Minimum Transaction Fee: 0.2 VRM \(high commodity transaction fee paid to miners\). RPC Port: 33987, P2Port: 36988 Confirmations: 30, Maturity: 100.
