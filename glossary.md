# Glossary

### Adversary model

The fraction of malicious or faulty nodes that the consensus protocol can tolerate \(i.e., it will operate correctly despite the presence of such nodes\). 

### Code available

Whether the code implementing the system is publicly available. 

### Committee

How the participants work together to participate in the consensus protocol; either they all work together \(single committee\), or they are divided in multiple subgroups \(multiple committees\). 

### Committee Formation

How the members of the committee are chosen, for example via proof-of-work, proof-of stake, trusted hardware etc. 

### Consistency

The likelihood that the system will reach consensus on a proposed value; it can be either strong or weak. 

###  DoS resistance

Resilience of the node\(s\) involved in consensus to denial-of-service \(DoS\) attacks. If the participants of the consensus protocol are known in advance, an adversary may launch a DoS attack against them.  

### Incentives

The mechanisms that keep nodes motivated to participate in the system and follow its rules. • Inter-committee Conﬁguration: How the members are assigned to the committee in a single committee setting; either members serve on the committee permanently \(static\), or they are changed at regular intervals \(rolling, or full swap\). 

### Latency

The time it takes from when a transaction is proposed until consensus has been reached on it. 

### Leader

The leader of the consensus protocol, which can be either elected among the current committee \(internally\), externally, or ﬂexibly \(e.g., through arbitrary smart contracts\). 

### Participants

The nodes that participate in the consensus protocol. 

### Permissioned blockchain

Only participants selected by the appropriate authorities can participate in the consensus protocol. 

### Permissionless blockchain

Anyone can join the system and participate in the consensus protocol. 

### Scalability

The system’s ability to achieve greater throughput when consensus involves a larger number of nodes. 

### Sharding

Sharding aims to split \(shard\) state information across nodes, without requiring any node to have a full picture of the network. Therefore no validator will validate all shards.

### Throughput

The maximum rate at which transactions can be agreed upon by the consensus protocol \(transactions per second/hour\). 

### Transaction censorship resistance

The system’s resilience to proposed transactions being suppressed \(i.e., censored\) by malicious node\(s\) involved in consensus.

###  Zero Knowledge Proofs

 A Zero Knowledge Proof \(ZKP\) is a method by which one party \(the prover\) can prove to another party \(the verifier\) that she knows a value X, without revealing the value itself.
