# Ethereum Proof of Authority

Ethereum Proof-of-Authority on Azure allows enterprises to build applications on an Ethereum blockchain that is not secured by a Proof-of-Work \(PoW\) consensus algorithm and consequently does not require mining. Since all participants on an enterprise blockchain network are known and reputable, governance can be separated from network operation. Azure features a built-in decentralized application \(DApp or dApp\) called the “Governance DApp” that provides consortium members with the authority to govern the network or delegate their voting power to others. Network participants can also delegate other nodes to vote on their behalf in the event that their primary nodes go offline, ensuring that all members maintain continual consensus participation. Network administrators, in turn, can use on-chain voting to vote on and alter network authorities in a transparent and auditable manner.

## Proof of Ambassador \(PoA\)

The Proof of Ambassador protocol, introduced by the Bitcoin Origin project, builds on Proof of Authority by combining it with Proof of Stake elements. It works by assigning a reputation score to validators who are publicly identifiable, known as Ambassadors. Ambassadors are chosen each month by users who stake their coins to cast votes. The consensus is based on pre-approved authoritative Ambassadors with a Proof of Authority approach. Reputation is assigned to Ambassadors based on several criteria including continual predetermined set of activities like promotion and campaigning of the Bitcoin Origin project.
