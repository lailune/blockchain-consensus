# Limited Confidence Proof-of-Activity \(LCPoA\)

Limited Confidence Proof-of-Activity \(LCPoA\) - a method for blockchain protection, based on the modification of the Proof-of-Work algorithm, in the direction of reducing the consumption of computational resources for the block generating. When using this method, the algorithm for block generating does not depend on the computing power. As a proof of work \(or activity\) the algorithm checks the time spent on the solution.
