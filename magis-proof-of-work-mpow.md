# Magi's proof-of-work \(mPoW\)

The magi's proof-of-work \(PoW\) protocol, in addition to required computational works to be done to deter denial of service attacks, is also a network-dependent rewarding model system. The mPoW rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical questions not only to validate transactions but also to create new blocks and generate coins. The amout of coins generated are constantly monitored by the mPoW protocol and tuned on the basis of an attraction-repulsion model: 1\) incremental rewarding to stimulate network activities during passive mining phase, and 2\) decremental rewarding to mitigate redundant mining sources during agressive mining phase. mPoW can effectively govern the magi's network and limit it under a certain scale, enabling the general devices to be capable of mining magi.
