# Proof of Care \(PoC\)

Rather than distributing presale tokens based on, say, how much users are contributing, companies can distribute token based on the quality of your proof-of-care for the project. On top of that, it's not even about social proof \(i.e., how many Twitter followers you have\), it's about the genuineness of your proof-of-care.

It's a great way to essentially crowd-market your blockchain project by encouraging others to get the word out about it. it's about producing interesting, fun, informative content.
