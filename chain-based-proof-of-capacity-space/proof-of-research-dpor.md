# Proof of Research \(DPoR\)

Each participant helps performing research by computations in Gridcoins network. The network average is similar to difficulty in PoW mining. As the network average rises it becomes harder to get the same magnitude so if you want to keep getting the same reward you would have to add more compute power if we have an environment of a rising network average. If the price rose significantly more compute power would come on board, raising the network average, making it harder to get the same reward, just like difficulty in PoW.
