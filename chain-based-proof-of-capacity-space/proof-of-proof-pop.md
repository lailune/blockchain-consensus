# Proof-of-Proof \(PoP\)

The Proof of Proof™ consensus protocol enables blockchains to inherit proof-of-work security from other blockchains, creating an ecosystem wherein security originates on established blockchains like Bitcoin and extends to other blockchains. The PoP protocol introduces a new type of miner who performs periodic publications of one blockchain’s current state to another blockchain. These publications are referenced in the event of a potential blockchain reorganization. PoP requires a blockchain has some means of creating blocks, such as low-hashrate local PoW, PoS, etc.
