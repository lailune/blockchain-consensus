# Proof of Ownership

This technique can be used by artists or businesses to certify the integrity, date of publication and ownership of their creations or contracts. A Proof of Ownership is always attached to a piece of data using cryptographic functions. This makes it impossible to alter the data after certification. If the content is modified, even by a single bit, then the whole certificate becomes invalid.

Only the people with the private key associated with the signature can prove they are the owner.
