# Proof-of-Stake \(POS\) / Proof-of-Presence \(PoP\)

1. Reward for generating blocks \(Proof-of-Stake, POS\). This involves running a full node, unlocked and with the user's stake applied to generate blocks. Users who run a block generating node generally need to have at least a moderate amount of token on their account
2. Reward for storing the blockchain \(Proof-of-Presence, POP\). Only the most recent blocks file is distributed amongst all p2p nodes, previous blocks files are not needed for normal p2p operations. Token incentives users to store and make available previously archived block files.
