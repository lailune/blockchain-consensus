# Proof of Zero \(PoZ\)

PoZ is an evolution of actual PoS, with the main difference that is capable of Zero-Knowledge transactions. PoZ gives every users the chance of earning interest over their owned coins, just as standard Proof of Stake. Last but not least PoZ is far away more cheap than PoW, in term of power & processor consumption. Zcrypt is an anoymouc cryptocurrency that uses zero knowledge proofs. It uses a Proof of Work/Proof of Stake protocol with a new algorithm, LyraZ.
