# Proof of Importance

NEM’s consensus network depends not only the number of coins but on the possibility that productive system action ought to be remunerated. The chances of staking a block are a component of various factors, including notoriety \(controlled by a different purpose-designed framework\), balance, and the number of transactions made to and from that position.

Productive network activity, not just the number of coins accumulated, should be rewarded. Participants who frequently send and receive transactions are more likely to find blocks.
