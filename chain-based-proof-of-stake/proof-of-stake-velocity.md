# Proof of Stake Velocity

Proof of Stake Velocity \(PoSV\) is proposed as an alternative to Proof of Work \(PoW\) and Proof of Stake \(PoS\) to secure the peer-to-peer network and confirm transactions of Reddcoin, a cryptocurrency created specifically to facilitate social interactions in the digital age. PoSV is designed to encourage both ownership \(Stake\) and activity \(Velocity\) which directly correspond to the two main functions of Reddcoin as a real currency: store of value and medium of exchange. Reddcoin can also function as the unit of account in heterogeneous social context.

## Used in

* [Reddcoin](https://www.reddcoin.com)
  * Not linear coin-aging function \(new coins gain weight quickly, and old coins gain weight increasingly slowly\) to encourage Nodes Activity. 
  * Node with most coin age weight have a bigger chance to create block. 
  * To create block Node should calculate right hash. Block reward 
  * Interest on the weighted age of coins/ 5% annual interest in PoSV phase.
