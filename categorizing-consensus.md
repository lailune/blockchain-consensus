# Categorizing consensus

We propose the following consensus categories

* Proof of Work
* Chain-based Proof of Stake \(includes LPoS, Proof of Importance\)
* PBFT and BFT-based Proof of Stake \(includes DPoS, Ouroboros, Byteball, and PBFT\)
* Hybrid models: Proof of Activity and hybrid PoW/PoS
* Proof of Burn \(shares some characteristics with chain-based Proof of Stake\)
* Proof of Capacity/Space \(shares some characteristics with PoW but also suffers from a \[lighter\] Nothing-at-stake problem\)
* Trusted computing algorithms \(e.g. PoET\)
* DAGs are mostly using a DPoS-like algorithm, \(except IOTA, which uses PoW\)
