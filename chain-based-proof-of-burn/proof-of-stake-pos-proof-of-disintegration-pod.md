# Proof of Stake \(PoS\) / Proof of Disintegration \(PoD\)

B3 is the first coin to develop and implement Fundamental Nodes \(FN\). A Fundamental Node is similar to a regular masternode in terms of the service it provides to the network but the coins used to purchase a Fundamental Node are destroyed. This reduces the overall supply of the coin over time as more Fundamental Nodes are added to the network. Fundamental Nodes receive 60% of the block reward while those staking receive 40%.
