# Proof of Burn \(PoB\)

With proof of burn, instead of pouring money into expensive computer equipment, you ‘burn’ coins by sending them to an address where they are irretrievable. By committing your coins to never-never land, you earn a lifetime privilege to mine on the system based on a random selection process. A user who gives up short term wealth proves that they are following the consensus mechanism and is rewarded with a lifetime privilege to mine the next block on the blockchain. Coins are sent to unspendable address

## Used in

Block creator rewarded with block rewards. 
* TGCoin \(Third Generation Coin\)
